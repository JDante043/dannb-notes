# TLDR
- This is a repository for my college notes, written with obsidian.
- While this README is written in english, the notes are written in Indonesian.
- Everything's written in markdown, use [this cheatsheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) to familiarise yourself if you want.
- If a note is missing, broken, contains misinformation, or the likes, please open an issue.
- The `.obsidian/` folder is not backed up to simplify things. It is up to you whether to download the recommended extensions.
