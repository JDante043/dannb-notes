"intergalactic standard.“
• Early 1990s: An industry shakeout begins with fewer

Mid-1990s: Kaboom! The usable Internet/World Wide
Web (WWW) appears. A mad scramble ensues to allow
remote access to computer systems with legacy data.
• Late 1990s: The large investment in Internet companies
helps create a tools-market boom for Web/Internet/DB
connectors.
